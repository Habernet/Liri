* If someone wanted to clone your app from github and run it themselves, they would need to supply their own `.env` file for it to work.
* "npm i" as everything is already listed under dependencies.



1. With node installed, navigate to directory. "node liri.js"

# Liri
A Siri like CLI app that responds to the commands "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", and "do-what-it-says".

## Motivation
This project was created as a learning platform for node.js and a few node modules! The project started very simply and as more knowledge was available, the project expanded to what you see it as now!


## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech/framework used
Ex. -

<b>Built with</b>
- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)

## Features
Instead of using process.argv to capture command line arguments, I opted for Inquirer! Inquirer is a npm package that will prompt the user for input.
Something else besides is Chalk! Chalk is simply something to make everything in the console look nicer. There can be some functionality to it as well. For example prompts will stand out more than an average line of text, and your options will also be styled different to the prompt.

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.
Install with:
```
npm i
```

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
<h1>Once installed properly you can do the following!</h1>
